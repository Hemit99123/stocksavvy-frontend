# StockSavvy Frontend
This is the frontend for the StockSavvy web platform. It includes the whole interface for all technology that is used by the platform.

## Technology üßëüèΩ‚Äçüíª:
### - NextJS:

NextJS is a framework of ReactJS. It provides all the tools nescarry to start development like a router and SSR (rendering static pages on server for better response times). It also has amazing SEO capabilities which will help make StockSavvy more popular in Search Engine searches like Google or Bing. 

### - TailwindCSS:

TailwindCSS is a CSS alternative that is used by many big companies like OpenAI, Shopify and NASA JPL. It allows us to design webpages through utlity class which saves productivity time because a standalone CSS file is no longer needed. This also helps keep bundling sizes to a minimum because we got rid of the need for an extra file. 

### - Husky:

Husky is a developer tool that allows bash commands to run prior to a Git commit being added (`git commit...`) This way, we can run some pre-checks on our code before it is committed onto the remote repository and added to the history of the repo **forever**

### - ESLint:

ESLint is a tool that allows for linting, published in 2013. Linting is a program that analyzes the code for any errors/violations to a certain set of rules. These rules ensure that the code is easy to read and production ready. 

## Contributions?

Contributions are allowed! We ask that you follow certain rules whilst making contributions. All work that you do will be **voluntary** and not privy to payment. However, you can use **your** contributions as work experience for any future work you might apply for. This can only be done if you follow our rules as listed below...

#### The rules:

When making contributions to this codebase, start by creating a issue. The naming of the issue should start off with:

- feat: (for a new feature)
- fix: (for a fix to a bug/feature not working)
- chore: (for any other task that does not fit the other 2 categories)

Once the issue is made, be sure to comment on that issue for all progress made. 

Now, we can create a branch for your work. **DO NOT COMMIT ON MAIN** 
The branch should have the following naming structure: `YOUR NAME/GITHUB USER/1-2 WORDS ON THE CONTRIBUTION MADE` Examples of such naming structure include `hemit99123/about-page`

Ok now create a PR with the **same name as the issue** and once you are done with your contribution, simply merge the PR and close the issue :)

The issues main function is to act as your source of documentation. All issues and work that you push into the branch should be commented in the issue.

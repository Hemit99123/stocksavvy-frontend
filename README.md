This is the frontend for the StockSavvy web platform. It includes the whole interface for all technology that is used by the platform.

## Technology üßëüèΩ‚Äçüíª:

### - React:
React is a UI library developed by Meta. I used it mainly due to its component reusability which saves repetition in HTML (JSX/TSX) code. 

### - Vite:
Vite is a build-pack for React which gives us the basic configs to set up a React project. It does this in a fast manner and its performance is the best in the market, making it a great choice to start-up the frontend.

### - TailwindCSS:

TailwindCSS is a CSS alternative that is used by many big companies like OpenAI, Shopify and NASA JPL. It allows us to design webpages through utlity class which saves productivity time because a standalone CSS file is no longer needed. This also helps keep bundling sizes to a minimum because we got rid of the need for an extra file. 

### - Husky:

Husky is a developer tool that allows bash commands to run prior to a Git commit being added (`git commit...`) This way, we can run some pre-checks on our code before it is committed onto the remote repository and added to the history of the repo **forever**

### - ESLint:

ESLint is a tool that allows for linting, published in 2013. Linting is a program that analyzes the code for any errors/violations to a certain set of rules. These rules ensure that the code is easy to read and production ready. 

## Contributions?

Contributions are allowed! We ask that you follow certain rules whilst making contributions. All work that you do will be **voluntary** and not privy to payment. However, you can use **your** contributions as work experience for any future work you might apply for. This can only be done if you follow our rules as listed below...

#### The rules:

First, create a development branch for your work. **DO NOT COMMIT ON MAIN** 
The branch should have the following naming structure: `YOUR NAME/GITHUB USER/1-2 WORDS ON THE CONTRIBUTION MADE` Examples of such naming structure include `hemit99123/about-page`

Now create a PR (pull request) to merge that development branch to the main branch. The naming of the PR should start off with:

- feat: (for a new feature)
- fix: (for a fix to a bug/feature not working)
- chore: (for any other task that does not fit the other 2 categories)
  
**Add all comments into the PR itself.** We will *not* accept any PRs without some sort of documentation/record of changes. Previously, all documentation was kept on issues. Therefore, if you want to look at a PR dated prior to Sunday, March 23rd, 2025 you must refer to the issues tab. **This practice is no longer in use however**.
